# MapReduce System with Kubernetes, Redis, and Python

Authors : Damien DASSEUX, Etienne Malacarne (SwallowedStar)

This repository contains code for a MapReduce system implemented using Kubernetes for orchestration, Redis for data storage and communication, and Python for implementing the Manager, Mapper, and Reducer components.

## Components

### Manager

The Manager component is responsible for coordinating the MapReduce process. It interacts with Redis to manage the Mapper and Reducer instances, distribute data to Mappers, collect results from Reducers, and orchestrate the overall workflow.

### Mapper

The Mapper component processes input data and generates intermediate key-value pairs. Each Mapper receives a portion of the input data, performs mapping tasks, and sends the results to the corresponding Reducer based on the key.

### Reducer

The Reducer component aggregates and processes intermediate results generated by Mappers. It receives data from multiple Mappers, performs reducing tasks, and produces the final output.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster set up with the appropriate configurations.
- Redis deployed in the Kubernetes cluster.
- Docker installed to build and push Docker images.
- Python environment for running the Manager, Mapper, and Reducer components.

## Configuration

### Kubernetes Config

The `info932-proj.yaml` file contains the Kubernetes configurations for deploying the Manager, Mapper, Reducer, and Redis components. Make sure to customize it according to your Kubernetes cluster setup.

## Building and Deployment

1. Build Docker images for the Manager, Mapper, and Reducer components.

To do so, use the `build.bat` script. Use it like so :
```bat 
build.bat <image_version>
```
Example : 
```bat 
build.bat v1
```

2. Deploy the Manager, Mapper, and Reducer components using the Kubernetes YAML configuration with the following command:

```bash 
kubectl apply -f info932-proj.yaml
```

## Data Preparation

1. Put the input data file in the storage of the Manager component using the `kubectl cp` command. For example:

```bash 
kubectl cp <local_file_path> manager:/data/<file_name>
```

I let the file "bible.txt", so you can just do :

```bash 
kubectl cp bible.txt manager:/data/bible.txt
```


## Starting the MapReduce Process

1. Send the start signal to the Manager component using a Redis command. For example:

```bash
redis-cli -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6379 publish start <file_name>
```

If you decidedto use the bible.txt, then it will be : 

```bash
redis-cli -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6379 publish start bible.txt
```
